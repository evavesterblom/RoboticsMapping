Mapping implementation

Two different implementations were made:
- using buffer (last 100 measurements for a cell, taking running average)
- using Bayesian method with Log Odds form, later for a map, value to probability is transformed

We focused on imlementation using Bayes and Log Odds Mapping method.

Our implementation need a bit tuning:
- tau should be introduced - this should help to generate more occurate represenation of a map
- measurement probability may be introduced to reduce noise
- there exist a problem of cell prability - when cell is set as free, then set as occupied which takes much time to update of a cell 

Log odds method overview:
- let's say that LIDAR's sensor makes a measurement of a particular cell - this detects an obstacle
- It is possible to update occupancy of the cell using log odds represenation
- Whether it is free or occupied - there must be set a probability to particular measurement
- We have taken 0.8 probability of cell being occupied and 0.3 cell being free
- In implementation - prior log odds is calculated, in the beginning 0.5 value is iset, which correspords to log odds = 0

For occupancy grid - mapping technique is used to represent the occupancy of a space. 
Log odds method is used to map probabilities into continious range of values from -inf, 0, inf.
Log odds form is used, the occupancy probability is represented as a logarithmic ratio of likelihood of cell being occupied.
Log odds form allows efficient update of the cell in a map when new info is obtained. Notation used is logit(p), where p is probability with two values (0, 1).
