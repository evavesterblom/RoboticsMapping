## Robotics

### IAS0060

Course aims to introduce various essential themes of mobile robotics, such as feedback control for motion, robotic vision, sensor fusion, bioinspired locomotion, path planning and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). We will teach practical knowledge that introduces you to contemporary methods of robot programming, either using the Robot Operating System (ROS) or directly programming microcontrollers to define robot software architecture and solve various problems from the above-mentioned fields.

**Tasks**

Tasks are divided into
- mapping (+ testing on a real life robot)
- localization (+ testing on a real life robot)
- path planning
